# 01. How JavaScript works?

- everything in JS happens inside an "execution context"
- JS is synchronous, single threaded language
- Single threaded means that JS can execute one command at a time
- Synchronous means that these commands can be ran in a specific order
- the place where all the variables and functions are stored as key value pairs -> memory creation phase
- the place where code is executed one line at a time -> thread of execution
- both (memory creation phase & thread of execution) are part of the execution context

# 02. What happens when you run JS code?
